/// Computes the central frequency used by the gammatone filter for each
/// channel. The frequencies are mapped according to the Equivalent Rectangular
/// Bandwidth (ERB) scale.
///
/// @param[in] numChannels The number of channels in the FilterBank. This must
///            be positive. The paper suggests a value of 64. If set to 1, then
///            minFreq and maxFreq must be equal; the filterbank will have 1
///            channel with central frequency equal to minFreq and maxFreq.
/// @param[in] minFreq The lowest frequency (in Hz) included in the bandwidth
///            of a channel of the filterbank. The paper suggests 80 Hz.
/// @param[in] maxFreq The maximum frequency (in Hz) included in the bandwidth
///            of a channel of the filterbank. The paper suggests 4000 Hz.
/// @param[in] fcArray A preallocated array of length numChannels where the
///            computed central frequencies will be stored.
///
/// @par Notes
/// A linear approximation of ERB between 100 and 10000 Hz, from wikipedia
/// ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_rectangular_bandwidth ),
/// is given by ERB = 24.7 * (0.00437 * f + 1). Both ERB and f are in units of
/// Hz. We use this approximation since it's the same as the one recommended
/// for use in the paper detailing our gammaton implementation. According to
/// that paper, the ERB scale (ERBS) for the linear approximation is 
/// ERBS = 21.3 * log10(1+0.00437*f). We can invert the equation to get
/// f = (10^(ERBS/21.4) - 1)/0.00437
///
/// @par
/// In general, the minimum and maximum frequencies (fmin and fmax) included in
/// a bandwidth B, centred on fc are: fmin = fc - B/2 and fmax = fc + B/2. If
/// there are at least 2 channels, the minimum and maximum central frequencies
/// are selected so that there bandwidths are just barely `minFreq` and
/// `maxFreq`. In other words: minFreq = min(fcArray) - B/2 and
/// maxFreq = max(fcArray) + B/2. If we plug our equation for ERB into each
/// equation, we can solve for min(fcArray) and max(fcArray):
///     min(fcArray) = (minFreq + 12.35)/0.9460305
///     max(fcArray) = (maxFreq - 12.35)/1.0539695
///
/// @par
/// We will space out the remaining central frequencies with respect to EBRS
/// We define minERBS = ERBS(min(fcArray)) and maxERBS = ERBS(max(fcArray)).
/// The ith entry of fcArray will have an EBRS given by
/// ERBS(fcArray[i]) = minERBS + i * (maxERBS-minERBS)/(numChannels - 1)
/// Finally, we can invert the formula for ERBS to get the frequency of each
/// entry: fcArray[i] =(10.^((minERBS + i * (maxERBS-minERBS)
