/// @file     errors.def
/// @brief    Error code list definition
///
/// To simplify the implementation/maintenance of error codes, they are
/// implemented with X-Macros. This file holds the list definition. The error
/// codes are used by errors.h
///
/// For each error, define: the enumeration-constant name
///                         the enumeration-constant value
///                         the associated error message
///
/// The way certain functions are currently defined requires error codes to be
/// negative integers. In the future, it may be more convenient to number them
/// in increasing order.
///
///
/// We definitely want to reorganize numbering in the future. But in order to
/// start to start, I'm going to suggest that we start numbering in different
/// ranges so that there to minimize the chance of collisions.
/// 
///       -1 through -100: common codes
///     -101 through -200: pitch detection
///     -201 through -300: transient detection
///     -301 through -400: MIDI file errors
///     -401 through -450: resample errors
///     -451 through -500: io related errors
